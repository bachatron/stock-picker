This was the third Ruby project from The Odin Project.

The assignment was the following:

"Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0."

The project itself got me a few days with my brain broken down trying to find the logic, but finally i got it and it was simplier than i thought. In the short future i want to retake it to review the code and make it concise and readable as it is now.

Este fue el tercer proyecto de Ruby en The Odin Project.

La consigna era la siguiente:

El proyecto me tuvo unos cuantos dias rompiendome el cerebro tratando de entender la logica, pero finalmente logre encontrarle la vuelta. En un futuro me gustaria retormarlo para revisar el codigo y hacerlo mas prolijo.
